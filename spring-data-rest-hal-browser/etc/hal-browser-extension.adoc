= HAL Browser extension

== Overall process

1. Meta-data resource discovery
2. Inspect metadata resource until we find a suitable representation (Content negotiation ftw!)
   - `GET $metdata-resource Accept: application/schema+json, application/alps+json`
3. From the returned representation -> build a form.

== Metadata resource discovery

=== Curie based meta data discovery -> bound to HAL, but avoids need to understand the profile relation

Prerequisites:

- only works if curies are used at all

Process:

- Expand curie to find out about metadata resource
- Start metadata evaluation

=== Profile link relation based meta data discovery -> independent of HAL

Root level: profile -> /_profile
Collection resource level: profile -> /_profile/customers
